# MedicareReimbursement

#Predicting the sum of Medicare fee–for–service reimbursements made during the calendar year for services covered by carrier claims from 2008-2010

#Data used in this analysis is from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Linkable 2008–2010 Medicare Data Entrepreneurs’ Synthetic Public Use File (DE-SynPUF)

#The dataset is known as CMS Beneficiary Summary DE-SynPUF and includes 32 variables. While most variables in the Beneficiary Summary DE-SynPUF have undergone imputation and simplification, their data format closely resembles that of the original dataset in the majority of cases (for instance, imputed county codes remain valid). However, in a few instances where the values no longer represent typical data, we've added an "SP_" prefix to the original variable name. Each entry within this dataset corresponds to a synthetic Medicare beneficiary.
