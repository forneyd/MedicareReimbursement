Predicting the sum of Medicare fee–for–service reimbursements made during the calendar year for services covered by carrier claims from 2008-2010

This research study aimed to leverage machine learning techniques, particularly multiple linear regression, to predict the sum of Medicare fee-for-service reimbursements made between 2008 and 2010 for services covered by carrier claims. The dataset utilized for this analysis was the CMS Beneficiary Summary DE-SynPUF, a subset of the CMS Linkable 2008-2010 Medicare Data Entrepreneurs’ Synthetic Public Use File. This dataset comprises 32 variables, likely encompassing beneficiary demographics, medical history, and other relevant factors.

The primary objective was to develop a predictive model using multiple linear regression, a statistical technique that examines the relationship between multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable, to estimate the total Medicare fee-for-service reimbursements. The model aimed to identify patterns and associations within the data to make accurate predictions about reimbursement sums.

Upon evaluating the Multiple Linear Regression model's performance, the R squared value, a metric that measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables in the model, was found to be 0.917. An R-squared value of 0.917 indicates that the variables included in the model could explain approximately 91.7% of the variance in the Medicare fee-for-service reimbursements. This high R-squared value suggests the model's strong predictive capability in estimating the sum of reimbursements based on the selected variables from the dataset.

Overall, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of employing machine learning, specifically multiple linear regression, in analyzing Medicare data to predict fee-for-service reimbursements, offering potential insights for resource allocation, policy planning, and optimizing healthcare services.
